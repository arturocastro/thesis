The progress made on this project in the period from January 2015 to May 2015 has been resented in this report. The motivation for this project, performance portability for heterogeneous parallel architectures, has been backed up by the current literature. Academic work related to this motivation, along with the most significant previous studies leading up to this project have been reviewed.

Projects with the same motivation have been surveyed, and one, the work in~\cite{dolbeau2013one} has been chosen for evaluating its results. The research methodology for performing this evaluation has been described and some preliminary results have been presented in this report.

Future work will focus on the completion of the tasks as they are defined in the revised plan also shown in this document. All tasks to be performed in the period starting from June to September have been listed and progress will continue to be made in order to meet the aim and objectives of this project.
