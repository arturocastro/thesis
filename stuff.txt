Experience

Nov 2013--Sep 2014Software EngineerAMI GE -  http://www.amige.comamige.comMonterrey, MexicoEmbedded real time system research and development.AMI is a GE branch, an international industrial automation and electrical drive systems company (600 employees).

Digitarc PX3 Electrode Regulator, a real-time industrial grade C++ solution for electrical regulation and monitoring of steel furnaces, with web and desktop clients.
  
  Researched, planned, implemented and tested voltage flicker measurement feature, providing accurate metrics for security and business in accordance to IEEE standards with no negative impact on performance.
  

  Implemented digital signal processing, numeric analysis and statistical routines for processing voltage and current signals and obtaining information from them.
  

  Quickly wrote and tested low-level driver for an I/O signal handling board to meet estimated sales.
  

  Implemented parallel data acquisition module by creating multi-threaded routines, enhancing data resolution and allowing a more detailed analysis of signals, which increases security and protection of business while maintaining real-time performance.
  

  Applied refactoring to code by using design patterns and adding tests, reducing complexity and code size of critical modules, allowing for less training time devoted to new recruits and making changes simpler.

Developed complete .NET web enterprise solution.
  
  User input, data analysis and reporting.

  Accelerated core feature releases and bug fixes by migrating from Microsoft Access to WISA, and then to LAPP stack (Mono and PostgreSQL).
  

  Designed, modeled and operated application's database.
  

  System administration (network configuration, software packages).
  

  Increased department security by installing and configuring Linux virtual machine: SSH client authentication program (C++), HTTP and database servers.
  
  

Developed module for Exchange server email messages retrieval, data parsing and storage, with automatic daily reports sent by email.
End-user, face to face requirements gathering, analysis and support.
